Assignments

a: = "My name":
b2: = (x^2)*3/(Hy^3);
A2b: = A*2*b;

Note that it has to start with a letter. It uses the := operator similar to pascal.

If an identifier has not been assigned a value, it evaluates to itself:
x2;
x2

but

x2: = a + b:
x2;
a + b

To clear an identifier:

delete(x)

To save there are two steps:

Step 1: Set your WRITEPATH variable
  WRITEPATH := "C:\\MuPAD";
Note the double \\
Another note is that this directory SHOULD ALREADY EXIST.

Step 2: Use the protocol command
  protocol("ex.1");

Lol. You can also just click File -> Save as...

Protocol() is readable for users but NOT for MuPAD.

To make it readable for MuPAD use the command:

write("temp.out"); 

This is readable by MuPAD, but not a text editor, to enable reading with a text editor use the command:

write(Text,"temp.out");

To read:
Step 1: Set READPATH:
  READPATH := "C:\\MuPAD";
Note the double \\
Another note is that this directory SHOULD ALREADY EXIST.

Step 2: Use the read() command:
  read("ex.2");

To research commands: fclose, fopen, fread, fprint, ftextinput

Types.
MuPAD type allocation is done implicityly and the type of a variable can change during the session.

Until an identifier is set, it is a type identifier of type DOM_IDENT.

You can test this with:
domtype(a);
where a is an unassigned indentifier.

DOM_RAT
DOM_FLOAT

No storage limit or significant figures limit, to set e.g.: use the variable DIGITS which has a default of 10 signi fig
  DIGITS:=100:float(PI);
I = sqrt(-1)

a: = 2 + 3*I: domtype(a);

DOM_COMPLEX

ac: = 2 - 3*I: b: = a*ac; domtype(b)
13
DOM_INT

A string is anything closed in " "

DOM_STRING
DOM_BOOL
