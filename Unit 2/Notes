Assignments

a: = "My name":
b2: = (x^2)*3/(Hy^3);
A2b: = A*2*b;

Note that it has to start with a letter. It uses the := operator similar to pascal.

If an identifier has not been assigned a value, it evaluates to itself:
x2;
x2

but

x2: = a + b:
x2;
a + b

To clear an identifier:

delete(x)

To save there are two steps:

Step 1: Set your WRITEPATH variable
  WRITEPATH: = "C:\\MuPAD";
Note the double \\

Step 2: Use the protocol command
  protocol("ex.1");
